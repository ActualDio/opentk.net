As part of the effort to revitalize OpenTK, we've managed to set up a modern,
clean and simpler website, which you're hopefully reading this on.

From time to time in the coming months we'll be writing a few tutorials here and
there for using OpenTK. For now, though, we'd suggest [This set of tutorials for
learning Modern OpenGL](http://learnopengl.com/). The examples and code given
should be trivially translatable from C/C++. If you need a hand, you can
always ask on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/opentk/opentk).

Our next steps from here are to simplify the build process and project
structure.
