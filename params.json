  "body": "## The Open Toolkit\r\nThe Open Toolkit library is set of fast, low-level C# bindings for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and OpenAL. It runs on all major platforms and powers hundreds of apps, games and scientific research.\r\n\r\nOpenTK provides several utility libraries, including a math/linear algebra package, a windowing system, and input handling.\r\n\r\nOpenTK is not a game engine, nor does it try to be one. It offers a useful set of libraries, and leaves it up to the developer to make the decisions on how to use them.\r\n\r\nIt is the ideal starting point if you want to write a game or scientific application from the ground up.\r\n\r\n## License:\r\nThe Open Toolkit is distributed under the permissive MIT/X11 license and is absolutely free.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/opentk/opentk/blob/master/Documentation/License.txt\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n### What platforms are supported?\r\nWindows, Linux, OSX, Android and iOS.\r\n\r\n### Which version is the official one?\r\nhttps://github.com/opentk/opentk/\r\n\r\n### How does this relate to the Xamarin OpenTK?\r\nThe Xamarin version is a fork of an ancient version.\r\nYou should prefer this where possible.\r\n\r\n### How can I get it?\r\nAdd the NuGet package to your project.\r\n\r\n### Who uses OpenTK?\r\nTODO: Add users.\r\n\r\n### How do I use this?\r\nTODO: Add a very brief guide to OpenTK\r\n\r\n### I need help!\r\nTry asking on the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/opentk/opentk).\r\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/opentk/opentk.svg)](https://gitter.im/opentk/opentk?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\r\n\r\n### Something is broken!\r\n[Open an issue at the repo](https://github.com/opentk/opentk/).\r\n\r\n### Who are the maintainers?\r\n@thefiddler is the head-honcho.\r\nOthers include @cra0zy, @amulware, @wcdeich4, and @varon.\r\n\r\n### How can I help?\r\nCheck outstanding issues, or drop us a message in Gitter.",
